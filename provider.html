<h1>snmpjs MIB Provider API</h1>
<div class="intro">


<p>MIB providers are software components that know how to handle and respond to
requests for SNMP data within a portion of the MIB.  Once a MIB provider has
been registered with an agent, the agent will begin directing requests for the
provider's MIB subtree to the provider's handler function(s), which are expected
to notify the agent via a callback when they have determined the correct
response to the request.  A MIB provider has no knowledge of any part of the MIB
other than the one for which it is responsible.</p>


</div>
<h1 id="mib-provider-descriptors">MIB Provider descriptors</h1>

<p>MIB provider descriptors are made available by providers for use by software
incorporating SNMP agent functionality.  Consumers collect and pass these
descriptors to the <code>Agent.request</code> method to register them with the agent.  Your
provider module must therefore export its descriptor(s) and should document how
they are structured.  You are strongly encouraged to make your module's
<code>exports</code> member a single Array object containing provider descriptors for each
object your provider supports (see the mib-2 provider included with snmpjs for
an example).</p>

<p>A MIB provider descriptor is any object instance with the following members:</p>

<pre><code>{
    oid: [String],
    handler: [Function] or [Array of Function],
    [ columns: [Array of Number] ]
}
</code></pre>

<p>or a dense Array containing any number of such objects.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>{
    oid: '.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1',
    handler: _mib2_system_descr_handler
}
</code></pre>

<p>Members are described in detail as follows:</p>

<h2 id="oid"><span class="method name"><span class="name">oid</span></span></h2>

<p>The <code>oid</code> member must be present, and must be a string.  It specifies the
address within the MIB of either a scalar (singleton) object or an object
representing a table entry type.  It must not contain any components identifying
an instance.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>'.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1'
</code></pre>

<p>is the OID of <code>.iso.org.dod.internet.mgmt.mib-2.system.1</code> or <code>sysDescr</code>.  It
would be incorrect to specify this as <code>'.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0'</code> because the latter
OID contains the instance number of the (singleton) instance of this object
within the MIB.</p>

<p>Similarly, if the provider manages a table within the MIB, its oid should
reflect the entry object type, not that of the table itself nor any of its
columns or rows.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>'.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1'
</code></pre>

<p>is the OID of <code>.iso.org.dod.internet.mgmt.mib-2.interfaces.ifTable.1</code> or
<code>ifEntry</code>.  Do not specify any of the columns below this node in the MIB such as
ifIndex (<code>.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.1</code>).</p>

<h2 id="handler"><span class="method name"><span class="name">handler</span></span></h2>

<p>The <code>handler</code> is a function or array of functions that will be invoked when a
request is received that is within the provider's subtree.  If this object is an
array, each handler will be invoked in an arbitrary order.</p>

<p>Each handler function will be invoked with a single argument of type
<code>ProviderRequest</code>, described in detail below.</p>

<h2 id="columns"><span class="method name"><span class="name">columns</span></span></h2>

<p>The provider descriptor for a tabular object specifies the OID of the entry type
in its <code>oid</code> member and a dense array of column numbers in the <code>columns</code> member.
It is not required that the column identifier space be dense, nor is it required
that the identifiers be ordered within the array.  Each entry is a positive
integer less than 2^31 specifying the last OID component of a column in the
table entry type managed by this provider.  For example, the <code>ifEntry</code> provider
has columns numbered 1 through 22 inclusive, so the <code>columns</code> member of its
provider definition would be a dense array of those integers.</p>

<h1 id="request-processing-overview">Request Processing Overview</h1>

<p>When an agent receives a request that it associates with a MIB provider, it will
invoke each of that provider's handler functions in succession.  The handler(s)
are responsible for performing the requested operation (if possible) and
invoking a callback with the result, which may indicate that an error occurred.
Exactly one of an object's handlers must invoke the completion callback; if
multiple handlers invoke the completion callback, the result is undefined.  This
behaviour may change in a future API revision.</p>

<p>Requests are directed to a provider as <code>ProviderRequest</code> instances, described in
detail below.  An agent will not direct a request to a provider that has not
been registered with it, nor will it direct requests that are outside a
provider's registered portion of the MIB.</p>

<p>The <code>ProviderRequest</code> instance contains a complete description of the requested
operation and a completion callback.  There are four basic operation types that
a provider may receive, which are defined by <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3416.txt">RFC 3416</a>.  Because the language
in the standard is somewhat complex, a simplified version is presented here with
a focus on the facilities provided by snmpjs.  Recall that there are two basic
types of provider: one that handles scalar data items and one that handles
tabular arrays of data items.  We will examine the necessary processing for each
in turn.  There are also four request types, defined by relevant standards, that
any provider must handle; each will be described here in brief.</p>

<h3>Operation Types</h3>

<p>The operation types are defined in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3416.txt">RFC 3416</a> and, for convenience, have
symbolic constants associated with them attached to the <code>snmp.pdu</code> object
exported by snmpjs.  They are:</p>

<table>
<tbody>
<tr><td>GetRequest</td><td>Read the single value specified by the request object</td></tr>
<tr><td>SetRequest</td><td>Set the single value specified by the request object and value</td></tr>
<tr><td>GetNextRequest</td><td>Read the single value FOLLOWING the request object</td></tr>
<tr><td>GetBulkRequest</td><td>Read one or more values FOLLOWING the request object(s)</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>The Get and Set requests do exactly what their names imply: retrieve or attempt
to change a specific data value.</p>

<p>The GetNext and GetBulk requests are used to walk the entire MIB or a subtree,
by issuing a series of requests such that the first request specifies the base
of the subtree and each subsequent request specifies the OID of the instance
returned by the previous request.  Such requests may be issued until the
management application reaches some defined stopping condition (such as
receiving a response for an instance beyond the end of the desired subtree) or
the MIB contents are exhausted.  The functionality offered by GetBulk is
somewhat complex, but is logically equivalent to a series of GetNext requests.</p>

<p>A more detailed discussion of how to handle each of these operations correctly
follows in the sections below for each type of provider.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>Each operation has at least one result, which must be passed to the completion
callback.  In the case of GetBulk requests directed to a tabular data provider,
there may be multiple results; in that case, the results should be passed to the
completion callback as members of a dense array.  Each such result must be one
of the following:</p>

<h4>undefined</h4>

<p>If the completion callback is invoked with no argument or an argument of type
<code>undefined</code>, the agent will interpret this to mean that the requested instance
does not exist within the subtree.  If the request was of type GetRequest or
SetRequest (see <code>ProviderRequest.op</code> below), this will result in an error being
returned to the management application in this varbind.  If the request was of
type GetNextRequest or GetBulkRequest, the agent will retry the request in the
next MIB subtree for which a provider has been registered, or return an error
indicating that the MIB view has been exhausted if none exists.  This behaviour
is intended to be compliant with <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3416.txt">RFC 3416</a>.</p>

<h4>An integer error code</h4>

<p>If the requested instance exists but a fatal error occurred during retrieval of
the requested data value for that instance, an integer corresponding to the
appropriate error code must be passed to the completion callback.  Any of the
error codes defined for the <code>error-status</code> object in section 3 of <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3416.txt">RFC 3416</a>
may be passed; for convenience, the <code>snmp.pdu</code> object has symbolic constants
attached to it associated with these error status values.</p>

<p>Note that most operations are not permitted by the relevant standards to return
all of these error codes.  If a provider responds with an error code that is
prohibited to the operation requested, the agent's behaviour is unspecified.
The detailed guidance below for implementing each type of provider describes the
circumstances in which each error code should be used.</p>

<h4>A varbind object (or an array thereof)</h4>

<p>Varbind objects are those created by calls to <code>snmp.varbind.createVarbind</code>.
Most requests should result in the generation of one of these objects (in the
case of GetRequest, SetRequest, and GetNextRequest) or an array containing
several of these objects (in the case of GetBulkRequest).  A varbind is simply a
key/value pair in which the key is an OID and the value is a typed data value
created by <code>snmp.data.createData</code>.  In all cases, the <code>oid</code> member should be set
to the OID of the instance whose value is being provided, which in some cases
may be different from the OID that was requested.</p>

<h3>Scalar Providers</h3>

<p>To a scalar provider, Get, GetNext, and GetBulk requests can all be handled in
exactly the same way.  The agent will not direct any of these requests to a
scalar provider that should not be satisfied by the singleton instance's data
value.  That is, a scalar provider should ignore whether the request is for the
singleton instance or the object itself, whether the request is for the named
instance or the next instance, and how many instances (in the case of GetBulk)
are requested.</p>

<p>To handle a Get, GetNext, or GetBulk request:</p>

<ol>
<li>Retrieve or compute the data item requested.  If the data item's value could
not be computed, invoke the completion callback with the single argument
<code>snmp.pdu.genErr</code>.</li>
<li>Use <code>snmp.data.createData</code> to construct a data object of the appropriate type
with the value obtained during the previous step.</li>
<li>Use <code>snmp.varbind.createVarbind</code> to construct a varbind object from the data
object created in the previous step.  The OID of the varbind must be the OID of
the singleton instance (i.e., it must end in <code>.0</code>).</li>
<li>Invoke the completion callback with the varbind object as its sole argument.</li>
</ol>

<p>To handle a Set request:</p>

<ol>
<li>If the object is not modifiable, invoke the completion callback with the
single argument <code>snmp.pdu.notWritable</code>.  This addresses clauses (2) and (9) in
section 4.2.5 of <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3416.txt">RFC 3416</a>.</li>
<li>Inspect the value provided according to the rules described in section 4.2.5
of <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3416.txt">RFC 3416</a>, specifically clauses (3) through (6) and (10).  If the value
fails any of the specified criteria, invoke the completion callback with a
single argument of <code>snmp.pdu.wrongType</code>, <code>snmp.pdu.wrongLength</code>,
<code>snmp.pdu.wrongEncoding</code>, <code>snmp.pdu.wrongValue</code>, or
<code>snmp.pdu.inconsistentValue</code>, respectively.</li>
<li>Attempt to make the requested operation take effect.  The meaning of this is
specific to the semantics of the MIB subtree and may include persisting
something in a database, altering a system parameter, or performing an operation
on a remote server.  If the operation fails because of resource exhaustion or
unavailability (even if retryable), invoke the completion callback with a single
argument of <code>snmp.pdu.resourceUnavailable</code>.  If the operation fails for any
other reason, invoke the completion callback with a single argument of
<code>snmp.pdu.genErr</code>.</li>
<li>Use <code>snmp.data.createData</code> to construct a data object of the appropriate type
with the value assigned during the previous step.</li>
<li>Use <code>snmp.varbind.createVarbind</code> to construct a varbind object from the data
object created in the previous step.  The OID of the varbind must be the OID of
the singleton instance (i.e., it must end in <code>.0</code>).</li>
<li>Invoke the completion callback with the varbind object as its sole argument.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Tabular Providers</h3>

<p>To handle a GetRequest:</p>

<ol>
<li>Determine whether the instance requested refers to a row in the table that
exists.  If not, or if the object itself was requested, invoke the completion
callback with no argument.</li>
<li>Retrieve or compute the data item requested.  If the data item's value could
not be computed, invoke the completion callback with the single argument
<code>snmp.pdu.genErr</code>.</li>
<li>Use <code>snmp.data.createData</code> to construct a data object of the appropriate type
with the value obtained during the previous step.</li>
<li>Use <code>snmp.varbind.createVarbind</code> to construct a varbind object from the data
object created in the previous step.  The OID of the varbind must be the OID of
the instance requested.</li>
<li>Invoke the completion callback with the varbind object as its sole argument.</li>
</ol>

<p>To handle a SetRequest:</p>

<p>SetRequests are handled in the same way as by scalar providers, with the
following exceptions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Prior to performing the procedures described above, determine whether the
instance requested refers to a row in the table exists.  If not, and it cannot
be created, or if the object itself was requested, or if the provider does not
support modifying its data, invoke the completion callback with the single
argument <code>snmp.pdu.notWritable</code>.</li>
<li>In the second step, clauses (7) and (8) must be considered as well, and the
completion callback invoked with a single argument of <code>snmp.pdu.noCreation</code> or
<code>snmp.pdu.inconsistentName</code>, respectively.</li>
</ol>

<p>To handle a GetNextRequest:</p>

<ol>
<li>Determine which instance, if any, immediately follows that specified in the
request in the lexicographically ordered OID space, or would if such an instance
existed.  Examples of lexicographic OID ordering may be found in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3416.txt">RFC 3416</a>
sections 4.2.2.1 and 4.2.3.1.  If there is no such instance in the column,
invoke the completion callback with no argument.</li>
<li>Retrieve or compute the data item associated with the instance identified in
the previous step.  If the data item's value could not be computed, invoke the
completion callback with the single argument <code>snmp.pdu.genErr</code>.</li>
<li>Use <code>snmp.data.createData</code> to construct a data object of the appropriate type
with the value obtained during the previous step.</li>
<li>Use <code>snmp.varbind.createVarbind</code> to construct a varbind object from the data
object created in the previous step.  The OID of the varbind must be the OID of
the instance identified in the first step above (i.e., not that which was
referenced in the request).</li>
<li>Invoke the completion callback with the varbind object as its sole argument.</li>
</ol>

<p>To handle a GetBulkRequest:</p>

<p>A GetBulkRequest is handled in the same manner as a series of GetNextRequests in
which each request's OID after the first is the OID of the response to the
previous request.  The only exception is that the completion callback should not
be invoked until all iterations have been performed and the result of each
iteration stored in a dense array.  The completion callback must be invoked with
the single argument of this array, each element of which is the result of the
corresponding iteration.  If an iteration's result if <code>undefined</code>, all
subsequent results must be <code>undefined</code> as well.  If a single iteration is
requested, the use of the array to store the result is optional; it may instead
be passed directly to the completion callback.</p>

<h3>Important Notes</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>If a GetNext or GetBulk request is received by a tabular provider for a
column object itself (i.e., no instance is identified), the response should
refer to the first instance in the table according to lexicographical OID
ordering.  If the table is empty or no row in the table has a value in the
requested column, the result of this portion of the operation is the empty
value; i.e., <code>undefined</code>.  If the table is not empty but the first row(s) have
no value in the requested column, the value should be returned from the first
row in the column which does have a value.</p></li>
<li><p>The agent does not validate the type of the data object passed by a provider
back to the agent, nor passed into a provider as the value of a SetRequest,
against any MIB definition.  Values of incorrect or unexpected type passed to
the agent by a provider will be returned to the management application
unmodified.  This behaviour may change in a future API revision.</p></li>
<li><p>The processing of Set requests is clearly intended by the standard to treat
multiple varbinds within a single set request message as an atomic transaction.
This implementation does not provide those semantics and does not conform to the
transactionality requirements laid out in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3416.txt">RFC 3416</a> section 4.2.5.  While the
use of SNMP for control operations is somewhere between uncommon and nonexistent
in practice, be aware that if your deployment does expect to perform control
operations, agents based on snmpjs must not be used if you expect or require the
atomicity specified by <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3416.txt">RFC 3416</a> section 4.2.5.</p></li>
<li><p>For scalar providers whose data items are relatively inexpensive to retrieve,
portions of the above procedures may be performed automatically by using the
<code>snmp.provider.readOnlyScalar</code> or <code>snmp.provider.writableScalar</code> interfaces.
Specifically, these interfaces will create the varbind objects from data value
objects and, in the case of read-only values, will reject SetRequests
appropriately.  They also invoke the completion callback.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>snmp.provider.readOnlyScalar</code> and <code>snmp.provider.writableScalar</code> utility
routines must not be used by tabular providers.</p></li>
</ol>

<h1 id="providerrequest">ProviderRequest</h1>

<p>This section describes the request objects passed to providers; the control flow
is described above.</p>

<p>Instances of ProviderRequest provide no methods.  All members and all contents
of those members are read-only and must not be modified by consumers.  Any
attempt to modify a member will result in an exception.  Any attempt to modify
the contents of a member will result either in an exception or undefined
behaviour.</p>

<h2 id="ProviderRequest.done"><span class="method name"><span class="name">ProviderRequest.done</span></span></h2>

<p>This callback function must be invoked by exactly one handler for each MIB
provider to which a request is issued.  Its sole argument is the result of the
requested operation, which is interpreted by the agent as described above.</p>

<h2 id="ProviderRequest.op"><span class="method name"><span class="name">ProviderRequest.op</span></span></h2>

<p>The requested operation, which will be one of the four request types in
<code>snmp.pdu.{Get,GetNext,GetBulk,Set}Request</code>.</p>

<p>The complete set of rules defining each of these operations may be found in
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3416.txt">RFC 3416</a>, but the discussion in this document should be sufficient to write
correct MIB providers for many types of commonly-encountered data.  Operations
of other types will not be passed to a MIB provider.</p>

<h2 id="ProviderRequest.oid"><span class="method name"><span class="name">ProviderRequest.oid</span></span></h2>

<p>The OID found in the actual request from the management application, as a
string.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>'.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.3.14'
</code></pre>

<h2 id="ProviderRequest.addr"><span class="method name"><span class="name">ProviderRequest.addr</span></span></h2>

<p>The OID found in the actual request from the management application, as an array
of non-negative integers less than 2^31.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>[ 1, 3, 6, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 14 ]
</code></pre>

<h2 id="ProviderRequest.value"><span class="method name"><span class="name">ProviderRequest.value</span></span></h2>

<p>The value to which the management application requested that this instance be
set, in the case of a SetRequest.  If the <code>op</code> member is other than
<code>snmp.pdu.SetRequest</code>, this member will be absent or undefined and should be
ignored by the provider.</p>

<p>The member is an object instance descended from <code>snmp.data.SnmpData</code> and
provides the interfaces defined in the <a href="protocol.html">Protocol API</a>.</p>

<h2 id="ProviderRequest.node"><span class="method name"><span class="name">ProviderRequest.node</span></span></h2>

<p>A <code>MIBNode</code> object corresponding to the location in the MIB where the provider
for this subtree was located.  This object provides the interfaces described in
the <a href="mib.html">MIB API</a>.</p>

<h2 id="ProviderRequest.instance"><span class="method name"><span class="name">ProviderRequest.instance</span></span></h2>

<p>The instance portion of the object identifier to which this request pertains, as
an array of non-negative integers less than 2^31.  This is the portion after the
column number in a table entry or <code>[ 0 ]</code> for scalars.  If the request pertains
to something that it not an instance, this member will be undefined or absent.</p>

<p>Note that the correct interpretation of this value may require it to be
translated into some other form; e.g., a string.  The agent has no awareness of
the expected type of the index into a table, even if it is defined by a MIB
definition.  This behaviour may change in a future API revision.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>[ 14 ]
</code></pre>

<h2 id="ProviderRequest.iterate"><span class="method name"><span class="name">ProviderRequest.iterate</span></span></h2>

<p>The number of consecutive instances following the specified instance for which
data is requested.  This will be set to 1, absent, or undefined unless the
requested operation is GetBulkRequest, and may be ignored by providers for all
other operations.</p>

<p>If this member is set to 1 and the operation type is GetBulkRequest, the
provider should behave exactly as it would if the operation type were
GetNextRequest.</p>

<h1 id="convenience-interfaces">Convenience Interfaces</h1>

<p>While the interfaces described above are sufficient to write any MIB provider
that may be needed, several convenience interfaces are also available to reduce
the amount of boilerplate code required to do so.  Use of these interfaces is
optional but recommended where appropriate.</p>

<p>These interfaces may be found as children of the <code>snmp.provider</code> object.</p>

<h2 id="readOnlyScalar(prq,-rsd)"><span class="method name"><span class="name">readOnlyScalar(prq, rsd)</span></span></h2>

<p>This function constructs the appropriate response to the <code>ProviderRequest</code> <code>prq</code>
from the data object <code>rsd</code>, then invokes the request's completion callback.  It
is appropriate only for scalar entities whose values cannot be changed by a
SetRequest.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>function
myProvider(prq)
{
    var val = snmp.data.createData({ type: 'OctetString',
        value: 'foo' });
    snmp.provider.readOnlyScalar(prq, val);
}
</code></pre>

<p>In general it is assumed that data may take some time to acquire from its
source, in which case this can be done asynchronously:</p>

<pre><code>function
myProvider(prq)
{
    slowOperation(function (result, err) {
        var val;

        if (err) {
            prq.done(snmp.pdu.genErr);
        } else {
            var val = snmp.data.createData({
                type: 'OctetString',
                value: result
            });
            snmp.provider.readOnlyScalar(prq, val);
        }
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that if the computation of the result is especially expensive, it may be
preferable to short-circuit the error case in which <code>prq.op</code> indicates a
SetRequest.  This convenience function handles this case correctly, but only
after the response has been computed.</p>

<h2 id="writableScalar(prq[,-rsd])"><span class="method name"><span class="name">writableScalar(prq[, rsd])</span></span></h2>

<p>Analogous to <code>readOnlyScalar</code>, this function constructs an appropriate response
to any request for a scalar data item that may be modified.  In the case of a
SetRequest, your provider must perform whatever actions are necessary to persist
the modification or otherwise cause it to become effective, then invoke this
function.  Note that it is not necessary to pass any value argument if the
operation was successful.  In response to requests for other operations, it
should obtain the value of the data item and pass it to this function as for
<code>readOnlyScalar</code>.</p>

<p>If a SetRequest operation fails because the data value could not be updated or
is of inappropriate type or out of range, your provider should invoke the
completion callback directly with the appropriate error code as described above.</p>
